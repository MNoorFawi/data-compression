# data-compression

Suppose you want to read large data into memory, store very big data into desk when you donâ€™t have much space or even transfer data for example model predictions through api. 
In such situations and in many others you will need data compression.
Here I tried to use python and compression techniques to compress data of numeric and/or categorical variables for better data storage and transfer.

``` python
python data_compression.py

######### Compressing Age and Class variables from GermanCredit data set:

###### Compressing Age Variable:
original age variable[0:10]:
 [67, 22, 49, 45, 53, 35, 53, 35, 61, 28]
original age is 9112 bytes
compressed age is 828 bytes
compressed age bit_string looks like: 2649857614701777378485660885771988844155.....
decompressed age variable[0:10]:
 [67, 22, 49, 45, 53, 35, 53, 35, 61, 28]
original and decompressed age are the same: True
space saving from original to compressed is 99%

###### Compressing Class Variable:
original class variable[0:10]:
 ['Good', 'Bad', 'Good', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good', 'Bad']
original class is 9112 bytes
compressed class is 292 bytes
compressed class bit_string looks like: 1221011526771983419993684773743626727824.....
decompressed class variable[0:10]:
 ['Good', 'Bad', 'Good', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good', 'Bad']
original and decompressed class are the same: True
space saving from original to compressed is 99%
